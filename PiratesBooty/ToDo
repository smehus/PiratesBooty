TODO:

In player touch path finding - I need to check if an obstacle already exists at the touch point...
... If its a GKPolygonObstacle, don't do anything

Will cannonDamangeComponent fall apart once there are multiple enemies
Need to remove graph nodes after paths are created?
Get rid of the land physics bodies & just check which tile its colliding with
Make an arrow indictor showing what direction the enemy is following you from
Random fort placement
Forts shoot player when within range
Ship picker at beginning
Rotate ships based on delta - rather than just immediately rotating
When enemies get stuck on walls - their paths get created over and over again!
Figure out why enemies aren't pathfinding around obstacles
When damaged - add ability to heal the ship - but when healing, you have to be motionless. Also enemies will recognize this and go after you.
figure out why certain land edges aren't getting picked up as edges
Implement ship upgrades - ships have different special abilities - start at white ship
