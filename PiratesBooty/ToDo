Random fort placement
Forts shoot player when within range
Ship picker at beginning
Rotate ships based on delta - rather than just immediately rotating
When enemies get stuck on walls - their paths get created over and over again!
Figure out why enemies aren't pathfinding around obstacles

figure out why certain land edges aren't getting picked up as edges
Implement ship upgrades - ships have different special abilities - start at white ship
